fyi.manipulatingimages
=========================

This sample applicaiton demonstrates how to store and array of objects with a single API call.

See the working application <a href = http://fyi.fatfractal.com/storingArrayOfObjects/ target = _blank>here</a>

Note: this is a work in progress - have modified the FatFractal.js, but am not happy with the current implementation. Will be improving this over the weekend.
